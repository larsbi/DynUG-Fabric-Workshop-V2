# Launch Fabric

Start a browser, either setup a new profile or use InPrivate browsing.

Navigate to https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/ Logon with the user provided to you. 

You have a note with your individual user name, the initial password is “Hell0Fabric” (0 is zero). When you initially login, you will need to create your own password.

Initially, you will be asked to change your password:

(we can help reset your password if you forget it 😊)

You may be asked to stay signed in, select your own preference.

Now you are signed in to Fabric and should see a screen like this:
